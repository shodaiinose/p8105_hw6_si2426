## Problem 2

#### Loading and Cleaning Data

``` r
homicide_df = read.csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "), 
         solved = ifelse(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0), victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age), victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White")) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX", city_state != "Phoenix, AZ",
           city_state != "Kansas City, MO",
           city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>%
  filter(victim_race ==  "White" | victim_race ==  "Black")
```

    ## Warning in mask$eval_all_mutate(quo): NAs introduced by coercion

The data was wrangled and cleaned by creating a variable for
`city_state` and a binary variable `solved` to identify cases that were
closed by an arrest. Several cities were filtered out and only victims
of White or Black ethnic backgrounds will be abalyzed.

``` r
baltimore_homicide = homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city == "Baltimore")

baltimore_logistic = 
  baltimore_homicide %>% 
  glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial()) 

baltimore_logistic_df = 
  baltimore_logistic %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) 

baltimore_logistic_table = baltimore_logistic_df %>%
  dplyr::select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

baltimore_logistic_table
```

| term             | log_OR |    OR | p.value |
|:-----------------|-------:|------:|--------:|
| (Intercept)      |  1.152 | 3.164 |   0.000 |
| victim_age       | -0.007 | 0.993 |   0.043 |
| victim_raceBlack | -0.842 | 0.431 |   0.000 |
| victim_sexMale   | -0.854 | 0.426 |   0.000 |

``` r
as_tibble(confint(baltimore_logistic)) %>% slice(4) %>% exp()
```

    ## Waiting for profiling to be done...

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 2
    ##   `2.5 %` `97.5 %`
    ##     <dbl>    <dbl>
    ## 1   0.324    0.558

A 95% confidence interval for the adjusted odds ratio for solving
homicides in Baltimore, Maryland in which the victim is male (keeping
all other variables fixed) is (0.32, 0.56). This indicates that
homicides in which the victim is male are less likely to be solved than
cases in which the victim is female in Baltimore, Maryland.

``` r
cities_logistic = homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  nest() %>%
  mutate( 
    models = map(data, ~glm(data = .x, solved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, family = binomial())),
    result = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>%
  dplyr:: select(-data, -models)  %>% 
  unnest(result) %>%
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) %>%
  dplyr:: select(term, log_OR = estimate, std_error = std.error, OR, p.value) %>%
  mutate(lwr = exp(log_OR - 1.96*std_error), upr = exp(log_OR + 1.96*std_error))

cities_logistic =
  cities_logistic[, c("city_state", "term", "log_OR", "std_error", "OR", 
                      "lwr", "upr",
                      "p.value")]
```

``` r
victim_sex_logistic = cities_logistic %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>%
  ungroup(city_state) %>%
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR))

ggplot(victim_sex_logistic, aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr)) +
  labs(x = "City, State", y = "Adjusted Odds Ratio") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 3

``` r
birthweight_df = read.csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>%
  mutate(babysex = as.factor(babysex),
         frace = as.factor(frace),
         malform = as.factor(malform),
         mrace = as.factor(mrace))
```

There does not appear to be any missing values in the data.

``` r
sapply(birthweight_df, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

    ##  babysex    bhead  blength      bwt    delwt  fincome    frace  gaweeks 
    ##        0        0        0        0        0        0        0        0 
    ##  malform menarche  mheight   momage    mrace   parity  pnumlbw  pnumsga 
    ##        0        0        0        0        0        0        0        0

    ##        0        0        0        0

In order to study the relationship between birthweight and several
factors, we will fit a model with all variables and perform a stepwise
regression to find an appropriate model.

``` r
model = lm(bwt ~., birthweight_df)

step.model =  stepAIC(model, direction = "both", 
                      trace = FALSE)

summary(step.model)
```

Running the stepwise regression, we will be studying the relationship
between birthweight and the following independent variables: babysex,
baby’s head circumference, baby’s length, mother’s weight at delivery,
family income, gestational age, mother’s height, number of live births
prior to this pregnancy, mother’s pre-pregnancy weight, and average
number of cigarettes smoked per day.
