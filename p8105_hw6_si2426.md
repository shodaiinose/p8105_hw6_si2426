## Problem 2

#### Loading and Cleaning Data

``` r
homicide_df = read.csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "), 
         solved = ifelse(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0), victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age), victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White")) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX", city_state != "Phoenix, AZ",
           city_state != "Kansas City, MO",
           city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>%
  filter(victim_race ==  "White" | victim_race ==  "Black")
```

The data was wrangled and cleaned by creating a variable for
`city_state` and a binary variable `solved` to identify cases that were
closed by an arrest. Several cities were filtered out and only victims
who are categorized as White or Black will be analyzed.

#### Baltimore, MD Logistic Regression

``` r
baltimore_homicide = homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city == "Baltimore")

baltimore_logistic = 
  baltimore_homicide %>% 
  glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial()) 

baltimore_logistic_df = 
  baltimore_logistic %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) 

baltimore_logistic_table = baltimore_logistic_df %>%
  dplyr::select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

baltimore_logistic_table
```

| term             | log_OR |    OR | p.value |
|:-----------------|-------:|------:|--------:|
| (Intercept)      |  1.152 | 3.164 |   0.000 |
| victim_age       | -0.007 | 0.993 |   0.043 |
| victim_raceBlack | -0.842 | 0.431 |   0.000 |
| victim_sexMale   | -0.854 | 0.426 |   0.000 |

The estimated odds ratio for solving homicides in Baltimore, MD with a
male victim, keeping all other variables fixed, is 0.426.

``` r
as_tibble(confint(baltimore_logistic)) %>% slice(4) %>% exp()
```

    ## Waiting for profiling to be done...

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 2
    ##   `2.5 %` `97.5 %`
    ##     <dbl>    <dbl>
    ## 1   0.324    0.558

A 95% confidence interval for the adjusted odds ratio for solving
homicides in Baltimore, Maryland in which the victim is male (keeping
all other variables fixed) is (0.32, 0.56). Since this interval does not
contain the value of 1, this indicates that homicides in which the
victim is male are less likely to be solved than cases in which the
victim is female in Baltimore, Maryland.

#### All Cities

``` r
cities_logistic = homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  nest() %>%
  mutate( 
    models = map(data, ~glm(data = .x, solved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, family = binomial())),
    result = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>%
  dplyr:: select(-data, -models)  %>% 
  unnest(result) %>%
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) %>%
  dplyr:: select(term, log_OR = estimate, std_error = std.error, OR, p.value) %>%
  mutate(lwr = exp(log_OR - 1.96*std_error), upr = exp(log_OR + 1.96*std_error))

cities_logistic =
  cities_logistic[, c("city_state", "term", "log_OR", "std_error", "OR", 
                      "lwr", "upr",
                      "p.value")]
```

``` r
victim_sex_logistic = cities_logistic %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>%
  ungroup(city_state) %>%
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR))

ggplot(victim_sex_logistic, aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr)) +
  labs(x = "City, State", y = "Adjusted Odds Ratio") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

According to the plot, Albuquerque, NM has the highest estimated odds
ratio while New York, NY has the lowest estimated odds ratio. In a
majority of cities, the confidence interval of the odds ratio is between
0 and 1, indicating that in many cities, homicides in which the victim
is male are less likely to be solved than those with female victims
(keeping all other variables constant).

## Problem 3

#### Loading and Cleaning Data

``` r
birthweight_df = read.csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>%
  mutate(babysex = as.factor(babysex),
         frace = as.factor(frace),
         malform = as.factor(malform),
         mrace = as.factor(mrace))
```

The data was cleaned by converting numeric variables such as `babysex`,
`frace`, `malform`, and `mrace` to factor variables.

``` r
sum(is.na(birthweight_df))
```

    ## [1] 0

There are no missing values in the data.

#### Fitting a Model

In order to study the relationship between birthweight and several
factors, we will fit a model with all variables and perform a stepwise
regression to find an appropriate model.

``` r
model = lm(bwt ~., birthweight_df)

step.model =  stepAIC(model, direction = "both", 
                      trace = FALSE)

step.model %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  dplyr::select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term        |  estimate | p.value |
|:------------|----------:|--------:|
| (Intercept) | -6098.822 |   0.000 |
| babysex2    |    28.558 |   0.001 |
| bhead       |   130.777 |   0.000 |
| blength     |    74.947 |   0.000 |
| delwt       |     4.107 |   0.000 |
| fincome     |     0.318 |   0.069 |
| gaweeks     |    11.592 |   0.000 |
| mheight     |     6.594 |   0.000 |
| mrace2      |  -138.792 |   0.000 |
| mrace3      |   -74.887 |   0.077 |
| mrace4      |  -100.678 |   0.000 |
| parity      |    96.305 |   0.017 |
| ppwt        |    -2.676 |   0.000 |
| smoken      |    -4.843 |   0.000 |

Running the stepwise regression, we will be studying the relationship
between birthweight and the following independent variables: babysex,
baby’s head circumference, baby’s length, mother’s weight at delivery,
family income, gestational age, mother’s height, number of live births
prior to this pregnancy, mother’s pre-pregnancy weight, and average
number of cigarettes smoked per day.

#### Plotting Residuals

``` r
birthweight_df %>% 
  add_residuals(step.model) %>% 
  add_predictions(step.model) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red") +
  ggtitle("Residuals vs. Fitted Values") +
  xlab("Fitted Values") + ylab("Residuals")
```

![](p8105_hw6_si2426_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

Looking at the residuals vs. fitted values plot, it appears that for
higher values of birthweight, the residuals are evenly distributed
around 0. However, for lower values of birthweight, the residuals tend
to be distributed greater than 0.

#### Comparing Models

In order to find the model that best predicts birthweight, we will use
cross validation to compare the stepwise model with two other models.
One model will look at length at birth and gestational age (main
effects) while the other model will look at head circumference, length,
sex, and all interactions.

``` r
comparing_models =
  crossv_mc(birthweight_df, 100) %>% 
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble))

comparing_models = 
  comparing_models %>% 
  mutate(
    step.model  = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ 
      babysex + bhead + blength + delwt + fincome + 
      gaweeks + mheight + mrace + parity + ppwt + smoken, data = .x)),
    main_effects = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .x)),
    interaction = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead * blength * babysex, data = .x))) %>%
  mutate(
    rmse_step = map2_dbl(step.model, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_main   = map2_dbl(main_effects, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_interaction = map2_dbl(interaction, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)))

comparing_models %>% 
  dplyr::select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model", 
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_") %>% 
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + geom_violin()
```

![](p8105_hw6_si2426_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

According to the cross validation, it is apparent that the step-wise
model has the lowest RMSE value while the main effects model has the
highest RMSE. This means that it may be most appropriate to fit the
step-wise model to predict birthweight.
